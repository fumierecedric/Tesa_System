# Execution Plans

This directory contains detailed execution plans generated by the Solution Designer agent for tickets in the backlog.

## Purpose

Execution plans break down complex features and requirements into manageable, actionable tasks that can be:
- Executed by Claude Code agents
- Resumed after interruptions
- Tracked through completion with checkboxes
- Referenced for implementation guidance

## Naming Convention

Plans are named according to their corresponding ticket ID:
- Format: `{TICKET_ID}_Plan.md`
- Example: `0003_Plan.md` corresponds to ticket `0003_Feature_Solution_Designer_Agent.md`

## Plan Structure

Each plan typically includes:
1. **Header**: Ticket metadata (ID, Title, Dates, Status)
2. **Overview**: Brief summary of the feature/requirement
3. **Analysis**: Problem understanding and solution approach
4. **Architecture**: High-level technical design decisions
5. **Task Breakdown**: Detailed, ordered list of tasks with checkboxes
6. **Testing Strategy**: Verification approach
7. **Rollout Considerations**: Deployment and integration notes

## Workflow

1. Product Owner creates tickets in `.claude/backlog/`
2. Solution Designer analyzes ticket requirements
3. Solution Designer generates execution plan in `.claude/plans/`
4. Development agents follow plan to implement features
5. Tasks are checked off as work progresses
6. Plans are updated when requirements change

## Usage

Plans are designed to be read by both humans and AI agents. They provide:
- Clear task sequencing and dependencies
- Technical context and decisions
- Progress tracking mechanism
- Continuity across sessions
