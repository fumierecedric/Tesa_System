## Summary

Improve meeting summary formatting by alternating takeaways and discussion points, and fix relative links to work from the root folder.

## User Story

As a user reviewing meeting summaries, I want takeaways and discussion points to be alternated instead of grouped together, and I want links to transcript files to be clickable from the root folder, so that I can navigate the meeting documentation more easily and understand the flow of the meeting better.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Meeting summaries alternate between takeaways and discussion points instead of grouping all takeaways together followed by all discussion points
- [x] Links in meeting summary files (e.g., links to transcripts) use correct relative paths that work when accessed from the root folder
- [x] Existing meeting summary format is updated to reflect the new alternating structure
- [x] Link format is tested and verified to be clickable from root folder context

## Initial Request

- you should alternate takeway and discussion points not group all take-aways togethers and then all discussion points together
- check links: [20251120-160000 Call Antoine-transcript.md](.claude/meetings/transcripts/20251120-160000 Call Antoine-transcript.md) from files like .claude/meetings/summaries/20251120-160000 Call Antoine-summary.md don't enable me to click on them - I work from root folder...
