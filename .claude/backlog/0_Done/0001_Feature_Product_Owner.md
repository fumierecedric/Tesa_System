- Create a Product Owner Agent (short name: PO)
- Store the agent configuration in `.claude/agents/`
- The PO will be responsible for managing the product backlog in `/.claude/backlog/`, that is the "tickets"
- The setup for the PO should be very light in itself, we will leverage Skills to implement the actual standard workflows of the PO
- You should create those Skills as needed, and store them in `.claude/skills/`
- A core skill "Backlog Management" should be created to start with
- The "Backlog Management" skill should implement at least the following workflows:
    - Initialize Backlog: in `.claude/backlog/`, create a folder structure: 0_Done, 1_WIP, 2_To_Do, 3_To_Plan, 4_Wait, 5_Archive if it does not exist yet
    - Prepare Ticket: for any given file in the backlog (raw note), per default look into 2_To_Do/ folder, prepare a ticket markdown file with all relevant fields (see below)
        - Assign a Ticket ID (incremental integer) based on all tickets in the backlog (4 digits, zero-padded, e.g. 0001, 0002, etc)
        - Create a markdown file in `/.claude/backlog/3_To_Plan/` using a template to be defined in the skill (in a dedicated sub-folder `templates/` inside the skill folder)
            - The template should include at least the following fields
                - Epic: Ask user for confirmation
                - Id: the numbering of the ticket (4 digits, zero-padded, e.g. 0001, 0002, etc)
                - Title: name of the ticket
                - Summary: a short description of the ticket
                - Type: (Feature, Bug, Improvement), ask user for confirmation
                - Status 0_Done, 1_WIP, 2_To_Do, 3_To_Plan, 4_Wait, 5_Archive
                - Created Date
                - Update Date
                - User Story: detailed description of the ticket
                - Acceptance Criteria: list of criteria to be met for the ticket to be considered done
                - Inital Request: a copy of the initial request that led to the creation of the ticket
                - Prioritization: (Low, Medium, High, Critical), ask user for confirmation - per default Medium
                - Sprint: assign to a sprint if applicable, otherwise leave blank
    - Update Ticket: update fields of an existing ticket as needed
    - Close Ticket: update status and move ticket file to 0_Done/ folder
- The PO agent should be able to leverage the "Backlog Management" skill to perform backlog operations as needed
- The PO agent should interact with the user to gather necessary information for ticket creation and updates
- Ensure proper documentation of the PO agent and the "Backlog Management" skill for future reference
- It's important for the product owner to ask clarifying questions to fully understand the requirements before creating or updating tickets
